# RouterTable

This Project is c command unit for a router table(fence only at the moment).

You do not enter the fence position, you just enter what to do(for example a dado on a specific position) and the software calculates the cutting passes for you.

ALWAYS BLOCK THE ROUTER FENCE AFTER MOVING IT, FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY! THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN BUGS, 
THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOUR HANDLS ARE NEAR THE CUTTING ROUTER BIT IF THE FENCE BEGINS TO MOVE!!

It uses a grbl board for the motor axis control and configuration.
So its easy to configurate the project for every hardware which is supported by grbl.

Because there is no documentaion at the moment, feel free to ask me if you are interested in the project.
